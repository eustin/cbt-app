# A React Native app for Cognitive Behavioural Therapy

This will be a simple app that allows the user to complete CBT journal entries.

The first version will not persist state in any way. All state will be held in memory.

## Why this app?

1. Mental health is extremelly important. Global events over the past few years have highlighted that many of us don't know how to take care of it. 
2. I wanted to learn React Native.
3. I've been a data analyst/data scientist for over 10 years. I've always gravitated towards engineering and am a "builder of things" at heart. It's time for a change! 

## The current state of the app

Warning: It ain't pretty!
