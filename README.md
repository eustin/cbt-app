# A React Native app for Cognitive Behavioural Therapy

This will be a simple app that allows the user to complete CBT journal entries.

The first version will not persist state in any way. All state will be held in memory.
 
## Disclaimers

I'm an Android user with a Windows laptop running Ubuntu on WSL2. I haven't tested this on an iPhone.
